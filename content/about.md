# About me

Hi, everyone!

My name is Omar, but I'm known as NSStudent. I'm an iOS developer from Madrid, Spain.

When I have time, I like to go to NSCoder meetups to share knowledge with all developers from Madrid. One of the things that impressed me the most, when I started as an iOS developer, was the good atmosphere in the iOS community.

This is my personal website, blog and lab to test all new features of Swift.

If you want to talk to me more, you can contact with me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nsstudent)

Cheers!
